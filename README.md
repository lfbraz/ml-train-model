# Machine Learning model training with Python
This implementation is for learning purposes. Could be used to learn how to train a simple machine learning model using Python.
Use your creativity to expand the use ~~to have fun~~ to fix a lot of real world problems and feel free to clone this repo and adapt this code for your requirements :)

These code were inpired from the https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/_static/notebooks/mlflow/mlflow-quick-start-training.html.

## [Activate environment](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
`pipenv shell`

## Flake8 config
Use the bellow code to adjust the max line length limit
flake8 --max-line-length=140

If you use VSCode you can add this config to settings.json adding the code:

```
"python.linting.flake8Args": [
        "--max-line-length=140",
    ]
```

## How to train the model
Run `run_train.py` 

## Clean up resources
